- :boom: Yo, I‚Äôm @Nine-by-design aka The :badger:***Man-Goose***:boom:

- :dna: Learning new skills is in my blood. Here to hear much, say little :speak_no_evil: . Mainly to make my first attempt at my own webpage to use as an artist portfolio. This will help me learn basic web design while marketing myself as a graphic designer.
- :beginner: I'd say my current level is a very rudimentary ability to navigate HTML, JS and some CSS. This is mainly due to Hashlips, who guided me through the set-up of his Art_Engine, which I used to successfully create my first NFT collection. "The VooDoodz" will be available Summer of 2024 on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/TheMongoose). 
- I'd love the opportunity to colab on some graphic :art: design, or better yet, an app :moneybag: that people could use to easily create, view in action and deploy their own logo designs.

- :pager: Drop me a line either by email toxichabit@proton.me or through my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/forever.unfinished.studio/).
- :male_sign:  Pronouns: Uhhhhh, I prefer to keep it scientific and stick with the biology of things, so I guess Dude, BroBro, Guy, smoking hot thang thang, the "wish" version of Jason Momoa. You know, the really technical scientific shit.
- :black_flag: A little bit of my weird: An artist in the true form. I create daily because I must. In many ways, it is a burden. I've had what I've started referring to as >"The Artist Brain" <sub>(Jordan Peterson)</sub> since I was a child, and it has tormented me and beat me down my entire life. It has also convinced myself as well as others that I am the greatest half alien bi-pedal creature to walk among the rest of you. Depends on the level of serotonin and who is in control that day. No matter who is during that day, I have at almost forty years old now come to terms with who I am, what I am. I'm not everyone's flavor. Trust when it comes to all the Humans out there, my pallet is very refined and picky. However, I have figured the best way for a weirdo like myself to be happy is to just do me and not give a flying firetruck what anyone else thinks about it.

With that, I will end with this:

- Thank you very kindly for visiting us here at ***The Murderous Mongoose Lounge,*** we do absolutely love company.

- Any advice, knowledge or general friendly banter is welcomed and encouraged.
  
-:biohazard: That being said, I am aware that creating rules let alone implementing them is [futile](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesOfTheInternet). But please, for your own sanity and general mental health as well as my own :biohazard::badger: ,
